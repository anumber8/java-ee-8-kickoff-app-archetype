===================

Basic project template to kickoff a new Java EE web application. Primarily designed for WildFly (10+). Live demo is available at [javaeekickoff.omnifaces.org](http://javaeekickoff.omnifaces.org/) (currently running WildFly 11.0.0 with Mojarra 2.3.3).

Note: For usage on JBoss EAP 7 alpha/beta or WildFly 10rc4 and below, JASPIC needs to be activated before the application can be deployed. See also http://arjan-tijms.omnifaces.org/2015/08/activating-jaspic-in-jboss-wildfly.html
